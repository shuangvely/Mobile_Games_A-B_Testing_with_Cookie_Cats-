# 🎮 Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats for Player Retention

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes player retention data from the mobile game **Cookie Cats** to evaluate the impact of an A/B test on player engagement.  
The goal is to compare **1-day** and **7-day** retention rates between a control group and a treatment group, using statistical testing to determine if the differences are significant.

## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing & EDA
- Cleaned and prepared raw game event logs.
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and visualizations to understand player behavior patterns.

### 2. Retention Rate Calculation
- Computed **1-day retention** and **7-day retention** for both control and treatment groups.
- Applied **z-tests** to compare retention rates between groups.

### 3. Statistical Validation
- Implemented **bootstrapping** to quantify the certainty of observed differences.
- Verified the robustness of the retention differences.
